# Kaggle Competition Scores

This README summarizes my participation and performance in various Kaggle competitions. Below are the details of the datasets, goals, evaluation metrics, and my scores.

## 1. Digit Recognizer Dataset

**Goal:**  
The objective of this competition is to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9). For each image in the test set, the task is to predict the correct digit label.

**Metric:**  
The competition is evaluated based on categorization accuracy, which is the percentage of correctly predicted images.

**My Score:**  
0.97014

## 2. Store Sales Dataset

**Goal:**  
In this "getting started" competition, the goal is to forecast store sales using time-series data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large grocery retailer based in Ecuador. The task involves building a model to accurately predict the unit sales for thousands of items across different stores.

**Evaluation Metric:**  
Submissions are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).

**My Score:**  
3.13377

## 3. Spaceship Titanic Dataset

**Goal:**  
The challenge is to predict which passengers were transported by an anomaly, using records recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system.

**Evaluation Metric:**  
Submissions are evaluated based on classification accuracy, the percentage of correct predictions.

**My Score:**  
0.79431

## 4. House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

**Goal:**  
The objective is to predict the sales price for each house in the test set. The task is to estimate the value of the `SalePrice` variable for each house ID in the test set.

**Evaluation Metric:**  
Submissions are evaluated based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted values and the logarithm of the actual sale prices.

**My Score:**  
0.20487

## 5. Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

**Goal:**  
The task is to predict the survival outcome of passengers aboard the Titanic. For each passenger in the test set, the task is to predict a binary value (0 or 1) indicating whether the passenger survived.

**Evaluation Metric:**  
The score is based on accuracy, which is the percentage of passengers correctly classified as survivors or non-survivors.

**My Score:**  
0.76315
